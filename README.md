# one-book-a-week

### Introduction

This repo will track my progress on developing a habit of reading one book a week. Inspired by Jim Kwik.

### Rough plan

1. Measure my current reading speed in PL and ENG
2. Read one Polish and one English book interchangeably
   - Use spreadsheet to track the reading speed for each book 
3. Plot the reading speed improvement
4. Use ANKI software (flash cards) to learn new English/Polish words
5. Use reading comprehension tests every xxx (frequency to be determined) weeks to measure the increase of the performance
   - tests to be carried out in English and Polish


### Technical side

1. Current reading speed to be stored in Google spreadsheet
2. Book speed reading to be tracked and stored in Google spreadsheet
3. Data analysis and plotting to be done in Google Colab
4. Use ANKI to record number of new words added & words learnt
   - Check if data from Anki can be easily accessed online (from within Google Colab) or exported and then added to Google Drive  and processed in Google Colab 
  

### Learning objectives

##### Soft skills:

1. New habit developed - regular reading
2. Increased reading comprehension
3. Increased vocabulary in Polish and English

##### Technical skills:

1. Learning to use Google Colab
2. Learning to use ANKI flash cards app
3. Improving Pyhton skill (mostly Pandas/Numpy/Matplotlib)
4. Improve Github skill


### Next steps

1. Finish measuring the current reading speed
2. Set-up the spreadsheet for measuring the reading speed of the books
3. Set-up ANKI app
4. Start working on the code
