# one-book-a-week

2020/01/05: 
 - This repo will track my progress on developing a habit of reading one book a week. Inspired by Jim Kwik.
 - Details to be added soon.


### Rough plan:

1. Measure my current reading speed in PL and ENG
2. Read one Polish and one English book interchangeably
   - Use spreadsheet to track the reading speed for each book 
3. Plot the reading speed improvement
